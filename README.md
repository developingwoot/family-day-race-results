# FamilyDayRaceResults

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration, particularly for Firebase settings. Here's how to set them up:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

2. The environment variables are processed by the `set-env.js` script, which generates the necessary Angular environment files.

3. For local development, the script runs automatically when you start the development server.

4. For CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), the environment variables are set as GitHub secrets and used during the build process.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
